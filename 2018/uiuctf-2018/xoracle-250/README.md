- The group `G` described is also known as the [Evil numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_number).
Interestingly, this group can be also reframed as the coset 1+GF(2^n), where GF(2^n) is the Galois field over 2^n elementsgalois field and `+` is xor.
We make use of that fact in the final phase of the solution.
