# Labyrinth

We can traverse a maze on remote. We have to find the exit by exploring the labyrinth maze. Eventually, we find that there are hidden mines at certain locations. Luckily the maze is identical each time, so we memorize where all of the mine locations are, and find a valid path to the exit using BFS and a lot of socket connections.
